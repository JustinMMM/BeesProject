				<p>What do you mainly think of when you see a bee? An insect? Some type of animal that you cannot disturb while it's working?Well there are many considerations you can add when you see a bee but the main one that comes to mind is that of course it's nature. Bees aren't decreasing as bad as people may think but it is still a worry, despite the small number of bees disappearing this is causing major issues in nature. How will other animals collect nectar besides butterflies and other animals?</p>
